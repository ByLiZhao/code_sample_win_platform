# code_sample_win_platform
This project contains code samples of C++ and C# code on windows platform, mainly MSVS projects
* Named pipe example in C#, a server and a client, in c_sharp/named_pipe_client.
* Normal distributed random number generator in C3, using the [Box-Muller algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform)in /c_sharp/normal_distribution/.
* A dll class written in C++, which operates on an unique device connected to the PC. A C# class which wrap the dll and marshal all call to the dll is built upon it. Assuming that the device returns RGGB Bayer format as part of data retrived from the device, the wrapper class also performs conversion to normal Bitmaps. 
* A simple csv writer class is contained in cpp/csv_writer.
* Example in folder code_sample_win_platform/cpp/wrap_rs_dll/ demonstrate how to embed a binary image of a file to a dll. Please note that the method is different from using resource files in a VC++ project as described in [this MSDN page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/working-with-resource-files?view=vs-2017). Our method employ a code generator which generates a head file. In the head file, a const global array is explicitly defined that is a binary copy of the original file. The header file is then used to generate a dll. The resulted dll will contain the file in it. The caller of that dll can use the exported functions of the dll to access that file.
